## Automated Chess - EECS 149/249A Project Fall 2022
### by Abigail Chin, Youngjin Park, Yuqing Wang

This is for a motorized chess board that is capable of moving pieces across the board, which would enable a player to control the pieces remotely against an in-person player moving pieces manually. This will include complex maneuvers like taking pieces, knight moves, and castling.  The player will end their move by pressing a physical clock button.
